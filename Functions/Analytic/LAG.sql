/*
Accesses data from a previous row in the same result set, LAG provides access to a row at a given physical offset that comes before the current row. 
*/

--Syntax
LAG (scalar_expression [,offset] [,default])  
    OVER ( [ partition_by_clause ] order_by_clause )

--Example 1: Compare values between years
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
SELECT BusinessEntityID, YEAR(QuotaDate) AS SalesYear, SalesQuota AS CurrentQuota,   
       LAG(SalesQuota, 1,0) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(QuotaDate)) AS PreviousQuota  
FROM Sales.SalesPersonQuotaHistory  
WHERE BusinessEntityID = 275 AND YEAR(QuotaDate) IN ('2005','2006');

--Example 2: Compare values within partitions
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
SELECT TerritoryName, BusinessEntityID, SalesYTD,   
       LAG (SalesYTD, 1, 0) OVER (PARTITION BY TerritoryName ORDER BY SalesYTD DESC) AS PrevRepSales  
FROM Sales.vSalesPerson  
WHERE TerritoryName IN (N'Northwest', N'Canada')   
ORDER BY TerritoryName;

--Exampple 3: Specifying arbitrary expressions
CREATE TABLE T (a INT, b INT, c INT);   
GO  
INSERT INTO T VALUES (1, 1, -3), (2, 2, 4), (3, 1, NULL), (4, 3, 1), (5, 2, NULL), (6, 1, 5);   
  
SELECT b, c,   
    LAG(2*c, b*(SELECT MIN(b) FROM T), -c/2.0) OVER (ORDER BY a) AS i  
FROM T;
