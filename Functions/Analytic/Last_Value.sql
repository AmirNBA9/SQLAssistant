/*
Returns the last value in an ordered set of values.
*/

--Syntax
LAST_VALUE ( [ scalar_expression ] )  [ IGNORE NULLS | RESPECT NULLS ]
    OVER ( [ partition_by_clause ] order_by_clause rows_range_clause )

--Example 1: Using LAST_VALUE over partitions
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
SELECT Department, LastName, Rate, HireDate,   
    LAST_VALUE(HireDate) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Rate) AS LastValue  
FROM HumanResources.vEmployeeDepartmentHistory AS edh  
INNER JOIN HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory AS eph    
    ON eph.BusinessEntityID = edh.BusinessEntityID  
INNER JOIN HumanResources.Employee AS e  
    ON e.BusinessEntityID = edh.BusinessEntityID  
WHERE Department IN (N'Information Services',N'Document Control');

--Example 2: Using FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE in a computed expression
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
SELECT BusinessEntityID, DATEPART(QUARTER,QuotaDate)AS Quarter, YEAR(QuotaDate) AS SalesYear,   
    SalesQuota AS QuotaThisQuarter,   
    SalesQuota - FIRST_VALUE(SalesQuota)   
        OVER (PARTITION BY BusinessEntityID, YEAR(QuotaDate)   
              ORDER BY DATEPART(QUARTER,QuotaDate) ) AS DifferenceFromFirstQuarter,   
    SalesQuota - LAST_VALUE(SalesQuota)   
        OVER (PARTITION BY BusinessEntityID, YEAR(QuotaDate)   
              ORDER BY DATEPART(QUARTER,QuotaDate)   
              RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING ) AS DifferenceFromLastQuarter   
FROM Sales.SalesPersonQuotaHistory   
WHERE YEAR(QuotaDate) > 2005   
AND BusinessEntityID BETWEEN 274 AND 275   
ORDER BY BusinessEntityID, SalesYear, Quarter;
